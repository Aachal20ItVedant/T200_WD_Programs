    <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: p better source needed </p>
<p>
In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" p and "end tag" p. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
<p>
Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
<p>
The start tag may also include attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the img used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: <img src="example.com/example.jpg"> </p>
<p>
Some elements, such as the line break br, or br do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
<p>
Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element p, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.</p>
<p>
The general form of an HTML element is therefore: tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">''content'
